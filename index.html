My name is Jeffrey Churchley, I was born and raised in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Growing up in Northern Ontario meant a healthy exposure to the outdoors which is why I love living in a country chalk-full of great outdoor adventures to be had around any corner. Being from Thunder Bay I was also exposed to a great deal of curling, hockey, and finn pancakes as anyone who visits here can attest.

Although it may not be evident in the photo due to my oozing photogeneity and glowing smile, I also love to travel and hike. The first picture in particular is the science centre in Vancouver, Ontario and the second picture is Silver Falls just outside Thunder Bay. My dream trip is to visit the coasts and countrysides of Italy, more specifically the Amalfi Coast.

<br>
When not delving in the outside activities my passion turns towards playing video games/board games with my friends, wracking my brain with puzzles and brain teasers, challenging people to chess matches, or my favourite activity to binge watch tv shows and movies. I have a love for anything that is challenging to the mind and gets you to think critically and come up with interesting solutions to overcome obstacles.
